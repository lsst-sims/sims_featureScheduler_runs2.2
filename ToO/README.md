Running some ToO experiements based on ideas from googledoc:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKeawNRj6PmDk87WXh-F3nO6xzbzjyj9lGo_AsdnC4k/edit

Trying to consolidate from the comments: 
100 square degrees in a circle, randomly placed on the sky.
If rising, wait for full area to become visible.

Range of ToO rates: 8, 16, 32, 64 per year
Range of number of visits (but always all 5 filters in camera) :
- 1 set of simulations with single g+z pass /  +1 +2 +4 hours / g+z on next night (6x30s per band)
- 1 set of simulations with single g+z+i pass /  +1 +2 +4 hours / g+z on next night (6x30s per band)
- 1 set of simulations with single g+z+i+r pass / +1 +2 +4 hours / g+z on next night (6x30s per band)
- 1 set of simulations with a single (u)griz(y) pass /  +1 +2 +4 hours / g+z on next night (6x30s per band)
(g+z pass on the next available night with 180s exposure â€”  for all ToOs which had at least 2 passes)

= 4 x 4 x 3  = 48  simulations
