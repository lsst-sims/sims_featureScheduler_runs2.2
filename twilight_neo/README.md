Try out twilight neo with 15s exposures

* vary the observing pattern (every night, every other night, on two and off three, etc.)
* vary if we are taking tripples or quads in twilight
* vary the filter set

Should the other surveys ignore the twilight or respect them (and count them as contributing to the footprint)?
* Currently they are ignoring.

Added a basis function so the twilight neo won't start observations unless the sun is higher than -17 degrees. Could try varying this limit if we wanted to.
