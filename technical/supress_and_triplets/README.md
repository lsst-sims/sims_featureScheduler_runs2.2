Request from Lynne on slack:

* modifies the suppress repeats basis function so it only removes visits within 2 hours of the original pair (rather than all night), then adds the suppress repeats basis function weighted fairly heavily
* adds triplets in the 'long gaps' format on a nightsoff 5/6/7 like way (maybe pick nightsoff 6? maybe do all of these options)
* adds 2-band rolling cadence at 0.8 weight
